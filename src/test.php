/**
 * PART 1
 * 
 * Welcome to the php knowledge test. The purpose of this test is to
 * test how quickly you can pick up the basic syntax of PHP
 * 
 * In part 1, we will focus on basic arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder)
 * You will be performing the basic arithmetic operation, and then assigning the result to a variable
 * 
 * For example, in Java, you can add and assign the result of the operation as follows
 * Integer result = 1 + 5;
 * 
 * However, PHP does it slightly differently. Part of this exercise is to see if you're able to figure out that difference
 * 
 * Remember, this is an open note quiz (please avoid AI-assistants, you'll be robbing yourself of the learning opportunity)

// subtract 10 and 1

// multiply 4 and 10

// divide 5 and 2

// get the remainder of 5 and 2

 * PART 2

 * Next, we will move to basic function definitions building on what was completed it part 1.

// Create a function (add) to add two values together (a and b)

// Create a function (subtract) to subtract two values (a and b)

// Create a function (multiply) to multiply two values (a and b)

// Create a function (divide) to divide two values (a and b)

// Create a function (remainder) to get the remainder of two values (a and b)

/**
 * PART 3
 *
 * Next, we will expand upon the functions and create a basic class
 * with functions within it
 * 
 * The name and structure of the class is specified in the comment below
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: For this excerise, make sure you explicitly specify the type of all parameters, and the return type
 */

// Create a class (MathOperations), and within it, create the following functions:
    // double => takes one parameter, and returns the parameter doubled
    // isEven => takes one parameter, returns true if even, false otherwise

/**
 * PART 4
 * 
 * Next, we will expand upon the class and use a couple of the functions. 
 * We will also introduce arrays, and one array function (array_map)
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: For this excerise, make sure you explicitly specify the type of all parameters, and the return type
 */

// declare an array with the values in this order 1, 10, 56, 2, 1

// use array_map to create a new array of booleans based on the isEven function in the MathOperations class
// for instance an array with values 1, 10, 56, 2, 1 becomes

// use array_map to create a new array of numbers based on the double function in the MathOperations class
// for instance an array with values 1, 10, 56, 2, 1 becomes

/**
 * PART 5
 * 
 * Finally, we will introduce associative arrays (similar to Maps)
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: For this excerise, make sure you explicitly specify the type of all parameters, and the return type
 */

 // Create an associative array with the following structure
 // Key        || Value
 // PHP        => 8.2
 // Apple      => Vision Pro
 // California => San Francisco
