# PHP knowledge test

This is a basic knowledge test for an intern-level position of their ability to pick up PHP (or their existing knowledge of PHP).

## Setup environment for the test

The bare minimum you need is a text editor/IDE (ideally that supports PHP syntax highlighting). But, if you want to test everything locally, you'll need to install PHP.

To install PHP locally, please follow these [instructions](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php).

Make sure you also clone (or fork) the repository. You'll want to setup your own repository where you can push the results.

## About the test

This is an open-note test (except AI assistants, you'd be robbing yourself of the chance to learn) to test how you would work being thrown into a new language and learning the basic.

This test also tests your knowledge of using git, since it requires you to clone the repository locally, and then publish your results to your own repository. Remember, it's ok not to know right now, but hopefully you can figure out how to by the end of this test.

This is broken into multiple parts, each one building on the previous. This isn't meant to test the advanced parts of PHP, but to see how quickly someone can pick up basic syntax.

## Important Refernces

Refer to the [documentation](https://www.php.net/manual) first. It'll be extremely valuable throughout this test.

## Online Editor

If you'd like to use an online editor designed for PHP, you can use [phponline](https://onlinephp.io/). Just copy the contents of the test.php file, and then once you're finished make sure you add all of your code back to the test.php file so it can be submitted to GitHub.
